    "The **insertion sort** algorithm is very efficient for sorting a small number of elements. Insertion sort works the way many people sort a hand of playing cards. We start with an empty left hand and the cards face down on the table. We then remove one card at a time from the table and insert it into the correct postion in the left hand. To find the correct position for a card, we compare it with each of the cards already in the hand, from right to left. \n",

    "I present my code for insertion sort as a procedure called `insertion_sort`, which takes as a parameter an array `A[0:n]` containing a sequence of length `n` that is to be sorted. The algorith sorts the input numbers **in place**: it rearranges the numbers within the array `A`, with at most a constant number of them stored outside the array at any time. The input array `A` contains the sorted output sequence when the `insertion_sort` procedure is finished."

    "## 2.3 Designing Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many algorithm design techniques. For insertion sort, we used an **incremental** approach: having sorted the subarray $A[0:j-1]$, we inserted the single element $A[j]$ into its proper place, yielding the sorted subarray $A[0:j]$. Now, we are going to learn the **divide-and-conquer** approach. This technique allows us to design a sorting algorithm whose worst-case running time is much less than that of insertion sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3.1 The Divide-and-Conquer Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Many useful algorithms are **recursive** in structure: to solve a given problem, they call themselves recursively one or more times to deal with closely related subproblems. These algorithms typically follow a **divide-and-conquer** approach: they break the problem into several subproblems recursively, and then combine these solutions to create a solution to the original problem. The divide-and-conquer paradigm involves three steps at each level of the recursion:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Divide** the problem into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.\n",
    "2. **Conquer** the subproblems by solving them recursively. If the subproblem sizes are small enough, however, just solve the subproblems in a straightforward manner.\n",
    "3. **Combine** the solutions to the subproblems into the solution for the original problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **merge sort** algorithm closely follows the divide-and-conquer paradigm. Intuitively, it operates as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Divide:** Divide the $n$-element sequence to be sorted into two subsequences of $n/2$ elements each.\n",
    "2. **Conquer:** Sort the two subsequences recursively using merge sort.\n",
    "3. **Combine:** Merge the two sorted subsequences to produce the sorted answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key operation of the merge sort algorithm is the merging of two sorted squences in the \"combine' step. We merge by calling an auxiliary procedure $MERGE(A, p, q, r)$, where $A$ is an array and $p$, $q$, and $r$ are indices into the array such that $p \\leq q < r$. The procedure assumes that the subarrays $A[p \\dots q]$ and $A[q+1 \\dots r]$ are in sorted order. It **merges** them to form a single sorted subarray that replaces the current subarray $A[p \\dots r]$.\n",
